Start by preheating your oven while you combine Â¾ cup sugar and 1 cup cold water in a saucepan and cook over low heat.

 After the water has evaporated, cook at maximum heat for 5-7 minutes until golden.
 
  Pour the mixture into desert forms. The cream, milk and vanilla come together in a saucepan and are cooked while stirring.
  
   End by mixing the eggs and sugar in a bowl until smooth and adding it to the desert forms. Bake and cool in the fridge.
